Timeclock - What Is It?
=======================

https://github.com/BoatrightTBC/timeclock

It is a simple yet effective web-based timeclock system. It allows you to track all employee time as well as upcoming vacations and more, and it can replace manual sign-in/sign-out sheets.

An administration piece is included which allows an administrator to add or delete users, change a user's time or password (if using passwords is enabled), and hide the reports from your users where only an admin or a reports user has access to them. These reports can be run to show daily activity or for a range of dates, and can be run for all users, or individually for each user.
